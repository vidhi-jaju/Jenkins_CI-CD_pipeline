- Jenkins agent container: For distributed builds
- Python build container: For building and testing the application

## 4. Steps to Perform This Project

### Step 1: Setup Jenkins
1. Pull Jenkins image and start containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```


2. Get initial admin password:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```


3. Access Jenkins:
   - Open browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`
   - Enter the initial admin password from step 2

4. Install plugins:
   - Click "Install suggested plugins"
   - Wait for installation to complete

5. Create first admin user:
   - Enter your desired username
   - Enter your password
   - Enter your email
   - Click "Save and Continue"

6. Configure Jenkins instance:
   - Keep the default URL: `http://localhost:8080/`
   - Click "Save and Finish"

7. Create Pipeline Project:
   - Click "New Item"
   - Enter project name: `simple-python-pyinstaller-app`
   - Select "Pipeline"
   - Click "OK"
   - In pipeline configuration:
     - Scroll to "Pipeline" section
     - Select "Pipeline script from SCM"
     - Select "Git" as SCM
     - Enter repository URL: `https://github.com/Aditya5757raj/Jenkins-CI-CD-Pipeline`
     - Enter branch specifier: `*/main`
     - Click "Save"


8. Install and Configure Docker in Jenkins Container:
   ```bash
   # Install Docker
   docker-compose exec jenkins bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker.io"

   # Start Docker service
   docker-compose exec jenkins bash -c "service docker start"

   # Verify Docker installation
   docker-compose exec jenkins docker --version
   ```

9. Install Docker Plugins:
    - Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins"
    - Click "Available" tab
    - Search for and install:
      - Docker Pipeli
      - Docker plugin
      - docker-build-step
    - Restart Jenkins after installation:
      ```bash
      # Restart Jenkins container
      docker-compose restart jenkins

      # Wait for Jenkins to start (about 30 seconds)
      # Then verify Jenkins is running
      docker-compose ps
      ```

10. Sign in to Jenkins:
    - Use the credentials you created in step 5

11. Run the Pipeline:
    - Go to your pipeline project
    - Click "Build Now"

### Step 2: Testing the Executable

1. Download the executable from Jenkins:
   - Go to Jenkins dashboard
   - Click on `simple-python-pyinstaller-app`
   - Click on the latest build number
   - Look for "Build Artifacts" section
   - Click on `add2vals` to download it to your local machine

   Note: The executable downloaded from Jenkins will be a Linux version since Jenkins runs in a Linux container.


2. To run the Linux executable on Windows using WSL:
   ```bash
   # Check if WSL is installed
   wsl --version

   # If WSL is not installed, you'll get an error
   # In that case, install WSL:
   wsl --install

   # After installation, restart your computer
   # Then open PowerShell and verify WSL is installed:
   wsl --version

   # To open WSL terminal, you have three options:
   # Option 1: Open PowerShell and type:
   wsl

   # Option 2: Press Windows + R, type 'wsl' and press Enter

   # Option 3: Click Start menu, type 'wsl' and click on 'Windows Subsystem for Linux'

   # Navigate to your project directory in WSL
   # Note: In WSL, Windows paths are accessed through /mnt/
   cd /mnt/c/Users/asus/OneDrive/Desktop/Jenkins/dist

   # Make the file executable
   chmod +x add2vals

   # Run the executable
   ./add2vals 5 3
   ```


## 6. What Does PyInstaller Do?

PyInstaller is used to create a standalone executable from the Python application. Here's how it works:

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Analyzes `add2vals.py` and its dependencies
   - Identifies required Python files, libraries, and resources
   - Creates a dependency graph of the application

2. **Bundling Phase**
   - Packages all identified dependencies
   - Includes Python interpreter
   - Bundles required libraries and resources
   - Creates a single executable file

3. **Output**
   - Executable is created in the `dist` directory
   - Named `add2vals` (or `add2vals.exe` on Windows)
   - Contains everything needed to run the application

### Benefits of PyInstaller
1. **Portability**
   - Single executable file
   - No Python installation required
   - Easy distribution

2. **Dependency Management**
   - All dependencies included
   - No external package installation needed
   - Consistent environment

3. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Creates platform-specific executables
   - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
   - Native performance

## 7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline setup using Jenkins, Docker, and Python. By following these steps, you have:

1. Set up a Jenkins server with Docker support
2. Created a pipeline that automatically:
   - Builds your Python application
   - Runs tests
   - Creates a standalone executable
3. Generated a distributable application that can run on any system
